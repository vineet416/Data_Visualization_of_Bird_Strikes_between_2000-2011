## Overview
Bird strikes pose significant safety and financial risks to the aviation industry. This Power BI dashboard analyzes over **25,000 bird strike incidents** to uncover:
- High-risk locations (airports and states).
- Key phases of flight and altitudes prone to incidents.
- Cost trends and their association with aircraft size.

The insights aim to help aviation stakeholders implement effective wildlife management and safety protocols.
